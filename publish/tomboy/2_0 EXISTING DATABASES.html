Campers
  Information about the camper
  For example: name, address, guardian, phone, physician, cabin group, no links
  Obtained from the pdf form filled out by the guardian.
  I think Joanne manually develops this table in the Quickbase.

Meds
   Information, dosage and frequency about particular medications
   For example: med name, dosage, frequency, who dispenses, links to camper fields

   I think that Eiko manually develops this table in the Quickbase.

   Based upon the Campers and Meds tables, this is the day by day
   schedule of medication administration. This table is the basis for
   the detailed printouts used by health supervisors, cabin leads and guardians.
   For example: date, day of week, time of day, links to Campers and link to Meds
   I think that Eiko develops this table in the Quickbase then executes
   the link to print reports.
